Census -  one of the undervalued information is what i believe and probably has the ability to transform the population with opportunities, growth and any progress that meets the interest of the nation as a whole, if analyzed in a right way. 

Making Sense of Census walks you through the process in which we categorize the information such that the government is able to analyze the age, efforts and exposure of a community in their ecosystem.

This project covers the following concepts:

    Array Appending
    Array Slicing
    Array Filtering
    Array Aggregation


I learnt to play around with larger set of information that leveraged me to explore the various horizons in a data set and the technical implications through which we can derive an optimized information. 

This project has different sub-targets, so i bifurcated the tasks to focus on one agenda at a time and then connected the dots at the end of the project to see the holistic view.
