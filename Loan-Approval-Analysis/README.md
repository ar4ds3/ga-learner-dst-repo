The numpy and pandas skills learned so far were used to analyze the data.
Building up this project enhanced the Data Wrangling, Numpy and Pandas skill.
This project focusses on designing the code in a generic and modular frame, and hence each and every task has been implemented referring to a user defined function, or a pivot/groupby table to analyze and executed the problem statement.
